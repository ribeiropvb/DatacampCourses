# 📘 DataCamp Learning Repository

Welcome to my **DataCamp Learning Repository**!  
This repo contains my notes, scripts, exercises, and mini-projects completed while taking courses on **[DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/)**.  
It serves both as a personal knowledge base and as a way to track my learning journey on the **DataCamp platform**.

I'm still deciding the exact track or learning path I’ll follow, but the main focus will be on **Python for Data Science** and/or **Data Engineering**.

Follow along — and let’s learn together! 🚀
